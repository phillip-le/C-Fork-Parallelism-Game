# C-Fork-Parallelism-Game
University project that implemented an arbitrary game to practise programming:
* Parallel processes that communicated with pipes
* API development for communication between processes
  * String parsing for API messages
  * Error detection to ensure that API messages complied with defined standards
* Makefile composition to create three different programs with minimal reuse of source code
